# Livepeer Lists

This repo contains some metadata about the Livepeer protocol.

## Transcoder metadata

The [/transcoders](https://github.com/dob/livepeer-lists/tree/master/transcoders) directory contains metadata about [Livepeer transcode candidates](https://explorer.livepeer.org/transcoders). This could be used to link to their transcoder campaigns or social info for developers building tools to help users evaluate transcoder performance.

### Contributing

If you'd like to update data about your own transcoder node, please make a pull request. Create a file in the /transcoders directory named <your-eth-address>.json, that follows the metadata format of the other JSON files in the directory.
